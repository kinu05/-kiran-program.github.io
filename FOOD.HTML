<B>Rajasthan Food Food Origins and Common Ingredients</B><BR><BR>
Rajasthani cuisine is influenced by its rich heritage and arid climatic conditions. The little availability of fresh fruits and vegetables distinguishes their cuisine. A few common ingredients are beans, lentils, gram flour, corn, barley, millet, bajra, bread and dairy products (esp. Ghee). There is more inclination towards vegetarian food, but various kinds of meat dishes prevail as well.<BR><BR>
